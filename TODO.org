*** TODO Non-destructive modifications

Store a list of modifications (rotations, compression, etc)
so that additional modifications can be performed as losslessly as possible.
e.g. rotate-right,rotate-right,rotate-right,rotate-right,compress,compress,compress
is the same as just compressing to the third compression level.

This could replace the more special-purpose and hackey remembering of the current compression level.

*** TODO Option to publish/copy URN of picture to clipboard

*** TODO Write documentation

Otherwise I'm going to forget how my own program works lol

e.g. how does -archive-map work

*** TODO Show files in archive-mapped directories

These should be read-only; don't allow modifications.  Maybe allow deleting, though?

Maybe have 'archived' grayed out (instead of yellow) to indicate it's not changeable.

*** TODO Loud indicator for very large images

Maybe a bright red border or something.
