Sort of based on Junko2 communication framework

send command
  get responses
  - events{0-*}
  - failure/result

different command sending styles:
  - call: send command, returning a response iterator; this is the most basic
  - send: send command without expecting a response
  - call-async: send command with a callback to handle responses, and return immediately


Command < RRA.Request
  uri
  verb = 'POST'
  content = Arguments

Event < RRA.Response
  name

Result < RRA.Response
  status
  content
  metadata

Failure < Result
  status = 500
